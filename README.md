Module 15 Challenge!

Third on Monday (Sort of!)

I based a lot of the code off of existing module 15 classwork. The City/State map is the underlying core of the challenge.

After banging my head against the wall for an hour on the Legend, I came to the conclusion I was wasting my time and have more challenges to do. Maybe I'll come around once I've submitted everything else and fix it. For now, oops!
